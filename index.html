					<h1>Hello</h1>
					<hr>
					<p class="section_heading">So you need a website.</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">You've tried to do it yourself</span> with services like WIX, Wordpress, or Squarespace, but all you got were cookie-cutter templates with little to no creative control. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">Or you decided to roll up your sleeves</span> and learn to use HTML and CSS yourself but got sick of things <i>just not working</i>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">Maybe you even tried some web design agencies</span>, hearing them talk about UI and UX and then grimacing at their insane costs and timeframes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">IDEV has an easier approach</span> to web development.  You can let us know how we can make the website you envision by filling out a questionnaire outlining your goals and expectations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether this be <span class="highlights">a clear and organized website</span> that converts readers to customers, or <span class="highlights">a visually attractive website</span> that showcases your business or portfolio, IDEV puts the control stick in your hands, and our prices and timeframes will have you wondering if we are robots that don't need sleep, or just crazy. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">So you want an app.</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">You have this idea.</span> Most people think they have good ideas, but you know this is <i>really</i> good. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="highlights">One problem, you don't know how to make apps.</span> You could try looking for a nerd to help you make the app. That's how the Winklevoss Twins made Facebook&mdash;oh wait.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maybe you could try learning how to make apps yourself! We commend your drive and mental fortitude. <span class="highlights">We'll still be here in a week</span> when you realize doing Codecademy is to knowing how to code as saying Hola is to speaking fluent Spanish. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Or you can let us help you. <span class="highlights">We've earned the trust of many clients</span> where discretion is an utmost priority due to the nature of their work. Your ideas are safe with us. Fill out a questionnaire outlining your goals and expectations, and you can let us know how we can develop the app you want. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">So you want something else.</p>
					<p>
						Aside from websites and apps, we also help with <span class="highlights">systems and network administration.</span> For a more comprehensive list, you can click <a href="#services">here</a> to go to our Q & A section. 
					</p>
					<p>
						But whatever it is you need, you probably still feel unsure about moving forward.  Feel free to <a href="#contact_section">fill out a questionnaire or reach out to us</a> with any questions you may have. <span class="highlights">We're not going anywhere.</span>

					<h1>Q & A</h1>
					<hr>
					<p class="section_heading">Why do I need a website?</p>
					<p>
						One main reason is that people expect to be able to interact with you even when they are not at your physical location. Whether this be browsing your products, reading about your company's values, or just getting into contact with you, if people cannot easily access information about you, they will look elsewhere. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">Why do I need an app?</p>
					<p>
					 	We are the mobile generation. Apps serve so many functions such as providing general information about what your company goals are, showing daily news updates, and gaining more visibility to your clients. With an app, you can expand your market coverage and gain the competitive advantage.
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">Why is IDEV best for me?</p>
					<p>
						We know it can be hard to choose a company to create a website or app for you. There are so many of us after all. We aren't the biggest or oldest company on the block, but we know how to learn and listen. We'll start a project not by showing you slides, but understanding what you and your users want the most. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">What if I don't really know what I want?</p>
					<p>
						That's normal! It isn't realistic to know exactly how you want the website to look from the beginning because the best website possible is a product of the entire process. Fill out our questionnaire and let us know your business goals and expectations for the site. We'll help you figure this out.
					</p>
					<a class="section_anchors" name="services"></a>
					<p class="section_heading">What is the full range of IDEV's services?</p>
					<p>
						IDEV can help you design and develop a website or mobile app. We also do SharePoint and ASPX.net development. If you need to migrate a website or an app, we provide this service as well. IDEV also offers systems and network administration services including infrastructure support, building servers (setting up exchange for emails, setting up VPN, and Citrix Servers), updating and upgrading servers, network engineering, and website hosting. If there's something you want but don't see here, feel free to contact us. We'll let you know.
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">What does IDEV <i>not</i> do?</p>
					<p>
						While we do provide marketing services like SEO, we are not a dedicated marketing company. If you need large scale marketing or commercial advertising, we recommend you find a dedicated professional marketing firm.
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">How much will this cost?</p>
					<p>
						We know some of the biggest hurdles in web and app development are the high prices. We want to lower that hurdle as much as we can. Pricing shouldn't be so painful or scary. A client that stays with IDEV means much more to us than a contract with a huge price tag, so getting a price quote from us is easy. Just fill out our questionnaire, and we'll report back with more details within three days.
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">So I pay the amount upfront and then you guys just start working?</p>
					<p>
						No. We don't see why clients need to pay an upfront price on a project that will take a long time to finish. Instead, every client will be able to create a payment plan with us so there are periodic payments along the development process. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">How long will the app or website take to finish?</p>
					<p>
						After completing our questionnaire, you can expect to hear an initial report back from us within three days. Depending on the size of your request, and the goals outlined by your answers to our questionnaire, development time can take anywhere from two weeks for medium sized endeavors to three months for the grandest projects. 
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">How much creative control will I have over my app or website?</p>
					<p>
						IDEV understands that there will inevitably be <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell" target="_blank">disagreements</a> on how a website or app should look. However, we also understand that we are helping you create your own vision. While we will adhere to our values of usability and clarity, your word is the ultimate decision.
					</p>

					<p class="section_heading">Sounds great. So how do I start?</p>
					<p>
						Even if you do not feel entirely ready, you should fill out our brief questionnaire that outlines your goals and expectations for this website or app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank">What do you have to lose? (sound warning!)</a> You will hear back in less than three days with more details. If you still have any questions, great, you are a normal person. Feel free to contact us.
